 <p> <h2>"There is a meadow in my perfect world, where wind dances the branches of the tree.The tree stands tall...and.. grand and alone ... shading the world beneath it. There will come a day when I rest against its spine...and look out over a valley where the sun warms, but never burns. I will watch leaves turn green, then amber, then crimson. Then no leaves at all. But the tree will not die. For in this place, winter never comes. It is here, I guard every memory of you. And when I find myself frozen in the mud of the real ... far from your loving eyes ... I will return to this place, close mine, and take solace in the simple perfection of knowing you."</h2></p>
